    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jose Arteaga. I am currently a Fourth year at UC San Diego,
        studying Mathematics - Computer Science. I am music lover who really enjoys listening 
        to rock and metal, specifically Spanish Rock. If there was a band I would call my 
        all time favorite, it would be Soda Stereo. Due to this interest, I also enjoy playing 
        Electric and Acoustic guitar, and some bass ocassionally. I like hitting the gym
        and watching UFC. Another hobby of mine is videogames, although I did take a break
        from it. My favorite titles are The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Super Smash Bros
        Ultimate. I like going out, whether it is a big hangout or small and I am always willing to
        meet new people. Feel free to message me and have a conversation with me. Looking forward to
        it. 
    </p>
